Contains a couple of helper scripts for my Roam usage.

1) gen_hotstrings.py - generates ahk_roam_hotstrings.txt that is used with autohotkey for date shortcuts in Roam.
2) gen_weekly.py - this generates my weekly template for Roam and creates a page with all of the days for the upcoming week with my daily tasks in it. Generates into the folder weekly/.
3) roam_gen - this script will change directory to the directory I use for my roam_scripts, run the gen_weekly.py script, and then open up the new file in VScode for ease of copying and pasting.
